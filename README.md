# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

The Spreadsheet program is currently in the process of developing a software application similar to Excel. The first significant milestone in this project has been achieved
, which involves the development of a formula evaluator , formula,spreadSheet,save and load

Moliang and I have navigated through a series of challenges as we embarked on our project,
encountering obstacles like difficulties with merging, figuring out how to save and evaluate,
and issues with deselecting cells. Despite these hurdles, Moliang and I have managed to
make significant progress, buoyed by our resilience and teamwork. We kicked off our work
last Sunday and have dedicated time to it daily, a testament to our commitment. We've
successfully tackled numerous problems, especially with merging, through mutual support.
Whenever Moliang faced implementation issues, we pooled our resources and found
solutions together. Although our pace has been slower than we hoped, our ability to confront
and overcome these challenges has been rewarding. Looking forward, we're keen on
enhancing our efficiency and streamlining our collaboration for even better outcomes in
future endeavors.

# My Software Practices section:
1. checkVairable method - I think is really good because I use the Code re-use method I check variable in many area which I check the variable type is valid or not
2. setContentOfCell logic - in this method I use seperation of concern by I using the switch method to test the case of each type 
3. create Normalize variable - I think is really good because I use the Code re-use method I will not woory about I forgot check the name wheather it is normalize in later 
that may cause many time to debug it.
